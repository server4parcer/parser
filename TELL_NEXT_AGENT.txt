CRITICAL MESSAGE FOR NEXT AGENT
================================================================================

READ THIS FILE FIRST:
/Users/m/git/clients/yclents/yclients-local-fix/NEXT_AGENT_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md

================================================================================
QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

WHAT PREVIOUS AGENT DID:
✅ Fixed provider field for ONE URL (b861100)
❌ Didn't realize different venues have DIFFERENT HTML structures
❌ Didn't test other URLs

WHAT I DISCOVERED:
🔍 Used Playwright MCP to inspect ALL URLs manually
🔍 Found b1009933 HAS DATA but uses DIFFERENT HTML structure
🔍 Found 2 URLs have booking disabled (remove from production)

WHAT I FIXED:
✅ Implemented multi-selector fallback (tries 5 selectors)
✅ Code now handles multiple page structures
⏸️ NOT TESTED YET - YOU NEED TO TEST IT

YOUR MISSION:
1. Test the multi-selector fix on b861100 AND b1009933
2. Verify CSV shows providers from BOTH URLs
3. If tests pass → commit and deploy
4. If tests fail → use Playwright MCP to debug

================================================================================
QUICK TEST (3 COMMANDS)
================================================================================

cd /Users/m/git/clients/yclents/yclients-local-fix

./clear_supabase.sh

# Test both URLs (see handoff doc for full test scripts)
# Then check CSV:
./check_supabase_data.sh

EXPECTED: Provider != "Unknown" for BOTH b861100 AND b1009933

KEY FILES
================================================================================

1. NEXT_AGENT_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md  ← READ THIS (full instructions)
2. src/parser/yclients_parser.py   ← Multi-selector fix (lines 1053-1075)
3. CRITICAL_FINDINGS_MULTIPLE_STRUCTURES.md  ← Why fix was needed

================================================================================
CRITICAL
================================================================================

⚠️ DON'T deploy until you test BOTH URLs locally
⚠️ DON'T assume one test = all work
⚠️ Multi-selector fix is NOT TESTED yet

✅ Test locally first
✅ Verify CSV shows providers from multiple URLs
✅ Then deploy
